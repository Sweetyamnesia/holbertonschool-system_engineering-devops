## How it works

1. **User request**: A user visits www.foobar.com.
2. **DNS**: www.foobar.com resolves to IP 8.8.8.8 via an A record.
3. **Server**: Hosts the web server, application server, application files, and database.
4. **Web server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, forwards dynamic requests to the app server.
5. **Application server**: Processes application logic and communicates with the database.
6. **Database (MySQL)**: Stores and retrieves persistent data.
7. **Communication**: The server communicates with the userâ€™s browser over HTTP/HTTPS.

## Limitations

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Downtime during maintenance (e.g., web server restart)
- Cannot scale under high traffic
